# Popular-Movies-App-Stage-1

Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
- original title
- movie poster image thumbnail
- A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
- user rating (called vote_average in the api)
- release date

# You must insert your own API key for theMovieDB.org in the Constans class. The App won't pull any movie data without it.
